#How to Read RAM and Dump RAM Data using LiME (Linux Memory Extractor)
This guide will walk you through the steps to read RAM information and dump RAM data using LiME (Linux Memory Extractor) on a Linux system

Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure that you have:

1.Root Access: Log in as the root user in the terminal to perform system-level operations.

2.Check RAM Usage: Use the "free -m" command to check the available RAM and its usage.

3.Install Required Packages: Install the necessary packages by running the following commands:

      (i)"yum install kernel-devel kernel-headers"
      (ii)"yum install git"

4.Installing LiME
Clone LiME from GitHub repository:

    "git clone https://github.com/vimallinuxworld13/LiME.git"

5.Navigate to the LiME directory:

    "cd LiME/"

6.Go to the 'src' directory:
      "cd src/"
7. Install make and gcc:
     (i)"yum install make"
    (ii) "yum install gcc"
8.Verify the presence of the lime file:
      (i) "ls"

Dumping RAM Data
Create a file to store the RAM data (e.g., myram.data):
touch myram.data
Dump RAM data to the created file using LiME
Note: The sudo command is used to execute the LiME tool with root privileges.

After running the above command, the RAM data will be dumped into the 'myram.data' file.

That's it! You have successfully read RAM information and dumped RAM data using LiME on your Linux system. Please be cautious while dealing with system-level operations, as they can have significant consequences if not handled properly.
